            In FE I didn't knew about BH, Scored around 7-7.5 pts and was sad,
            friends scoring more than me with ease and I wanted to learn that
            smart way too. I got introduced to BH via WhatsApp Group and then I
            Scored 8.44 in Sem 3 and a whopping 9.3 in Sem 4. Just by solving BH
            Question Banks and Studying their Analytics of the Previous Year
            Papers and Study Material at the Exam Leave. Thank You BH :) you're
            the best!

            I had more than 5 kts and specially in BEE I was upset about that +
            my regular college syllabus. After getting into Brainheaters things
            started becoming very easy, I learnt a new perspective, started
            following them & their materials, and then finally those kt are
            clear in one attempt so thank you BH.

            come to know about brainheaters. In first sem my pointer was 7.67

            lot about how to write paper, perfect study material and smart
            study. Then in next sem I jumped to 8.89 and it was really
